## Running the Client

To start the client, execute the following command:

```sh
java -jar haj-client-1.0.jar
```

You will be prompted to enter the host (e.g., 127.0.0.1) and port (e.g., 8080) or press Enter to use the default values.
The application will then launch, allowing you to enter a username, create or join a lobby, and start playing.
