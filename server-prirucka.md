## Running the Server

To start the server, execute the following command:

```sh
java -jar haj-server-1.0.jar
```

You will be prompted to enter the port (e.g., 8080) or press Enter to use the default values.
The server will then start, waiting for clients to connect.
The server can be stopped by pressing Enter again.
